All the STL files I've modified for the MiniMerc.

The skirts were a ground up design and not nearly as good as the original ZeroG skirt files. I decided not to modify the existing skirts because I broke some geometry and it was easier to just make my own. I'm still working on modifying the original skirt files and will post them here when I have them done. 

These are still a work in progress and changes are likely to happen, however as they are they work fine. The only real changes I can see happening are some minor tolerance corrections or adjusting the locations of certain features. 

The only files here are MiniMerc specific. If it's not here you can just use the original Nebula STL's that can be found on Discord.
