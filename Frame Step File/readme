The MiniMerc frame is a work in progress. Nothing in the design is final. There is currently no work instructions for hole locations, you will have to get those dimensions from the CAD file.

Assembly is very similar to the ZeroG Nebula frame. It uses blind joints for all mating surfaces, so make sure you drill holes accurately.
