First create a new directory in your config files called MiniMerc, then add the above .cfg files you wish to include to that directory. 

Next add [include MiniMerc/*.cfg] to your printer.cfg. This will automatically include all .cfg files in the MiniMerc directory. That's it, you're all set!

I've found that it's best to keep config files separate to easily navigate to the things you want to change without having to scroll and search for what you want. This is just what I do, feel free to not do any of this, it all works the same in the end.
