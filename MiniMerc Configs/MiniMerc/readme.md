First create a new directory in your config files called MiniMerc, then add the above files to that directory. Next add [include MiniMerc/*.cfg] to your printer.cfg. This will automatically include all .cfg files in the MiniMerc directory. Then add the .cfg files you wish to use to the MiniMerc directory and you're all set!

I've found that it's best to keep config files separate to easily navigate to the things you want to change without having to scroll and search for what you want.
