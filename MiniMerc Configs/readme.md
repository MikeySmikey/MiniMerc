Replace your existing printer.cfg file with the one above.

This printer.cfg is based on the BTT Octopus Pro 1.0, so your config may be different. 

To keep the printer.cfg file clean do not add config changes to the printer.cfg. Instead navigate to the MiniMerc folder and edit an existing .cfg file or create a new .cfg file with the parameters you wish to add.
